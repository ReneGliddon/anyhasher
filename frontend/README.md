# Getting Started with Create React App
This is a test change
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project has a CI/CD pipeline set up with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This pipeline automates testing, linting, building, and deploying the application.

### Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

- **Build**: The frontend is built using Node.js (version 16) and dependencies are installed from `package-lock.json`.
- **Audit**: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies are checked using `npm audit`.
- **Lint**: The code is linted to ensure it follows the defined code style.
- **Test**: Unit tests are run to verify the functionality of the application.
- **Static Analysis**: Static code analysis is performed using [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql).
- **Deploy**: The built frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Verify**: After deployment, a smoke test is run to verify the deployment was successful.

### How the CI/CD Pipeline is Triggered

The pipeline is triggered automatically when:
- A **pull request** is made.
- A **push** is made to the `main` branch (or a specified branch like `olt` in some cases).

### How to View Pipeline Status

You can view the status and results of the pipeline runs in the **Actions** tab of this GitHub repository.
